"""Nodes that make up parse trees

Parsing spits out a tree of these, which you can then tell to walk itself and
spit out a useful value. Or you can walk it yourself; the structural attributes
are public.

class Node:
    """A parse tree node

    Consider these immutable once constructed. As a side effect of a
    memory-saving strategy in the cache, multiple references to a single
    ``Node`` might be returned in a single parse tree. So, if you start
    messing with one, you'll see surprising parallel changes pop up elsewhere.

    My philosophy is that parse trees (and their nodes) should be
    representation-agnostic. That is, they shouldn't get all mixed up with what
    the final rendered form of a wiki page (or the intermediate representation
    of a programming language, or whatever) is going to be: you should be able
    to parse once and render several representations from the tree, one after
    another.

    is very similar to that of ``ast.NodeVisitor``.

    These could easily all be static methods, but that would add at least as
    much weirdness at the call site as the ``()`` for instantiation. And this
    way, we support subclasses that require state: options, for example, or a
    symbol table constructed from a programming language's AST.

    We never transform the parse tree in place, because...

    * There are likely multiple references to the same ``Node`` object in a
      parse tree, and changes to one reference would surprise you elsewhere.
    * It makes it impossible to report errors: you'd end up with the "error"
      arrow pointing someplace in a half-transformed mishmash of nodes--and
      that's assuming you're even transforming the tree into another tree.

    Notice that there is no "digit = " as part of the rule; that gets inferred

    In cases where there is only one kind of visitor interested in a grammar,
    using ``@rule`` saves you having to look back and forth between the visitor
    and the grammar definition.

    On an implementation level, all ``@rule`` rules get stitched together into
    a :class:`~.Grammar` that becomes the NodeVisitor's
    :term:`default grammar`.

    Typically, the choice of a default rule for this grammar is simple: whatever
    ``@rule`` comes first in the class is the default. But the choice may become
    surprising if you divide the ``@rule`` calls among subclasses. At the
    moment, which method "comes first" is decided simply by comparing line
    numbers, so whatever method is on the smallest-numbered line will be the
    default. In a future release, this will change to pick the
    first ``@rule`` call on the basemost class that has one. That way, a
    subclass which does not override the default rule's ``visit_*`` method
    won't unintentionally change which rule is the default.
